"""The interrupt node (CLAUDE.md section 6.1).

TRAP 3, and the single most important constraint in this file: on resume,
LangGraph re-executes the interrupted node FROM ITS FIRST LINE. Anything placed
before interrupt() runs twice -- once when the graph suspends and again when it
resumes. An LLM call there would be billed twice and, worse, could produce two
different drafts.

So this node contains nothing but interrupt() and writes that are safe to repeat.
No LLM calls, no HTTP, no database writes, no counters. If you are tempted to add
something here, put it in the node that routes out of here instead.
